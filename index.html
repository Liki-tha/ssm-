This department opines that Art-making involves skills that can be learnt. This Art is an essential part of the enlightenment process.The unapparent artistic talents of the students are brought to the spotlight during various occasions, functions and festivals. The students can opt for any one of the Fine Arts- namely Carnatic Music (vocal), Bharathanatyam, Violin, Mridangam, Keyboard, Art and Craft.

        <h1>Montessori System Of Education</h1>
        <span><img src="mm1933.jpg"> <img src="download.jpg" id="img1"></span>
        <p id="p1">Dr. Maria Montessori was born in Italy, in 1870. She founded the first Casa Dei Bambini – Children’s House, in 1906. Montessori education has a fundamental influence on all modern methods of education. The primary need of education is to enable children to grow up into good citizens of tomorrow’s world. The children in the prime of their age, 2 ½ - 7 ½ years, learn through the Montessori system of education. It is a five-year continuous course based on the psychology of the children. They learn on their own in a phased manner, using scientific and sophisticated materials. The classroom milieu plays a significant role in the educational attainment of children, promoting their inquisitiveness and inclination to learn.</p>

        <h2 class="vine">Our Scouts – Ambedkar Scout Troop</h2>
        <p id="p1">Scouting is a movement that aims to support young people in their physical, mental and spiritual development with a strong focus on the survival skills in such a way that they play constructive roles in the society. Scouts spend time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals and activities. This emphasizes good citizenship and decision-making in youngsters. Camps occur a few times in a year and may involve several groups from a local area or region camping together for a weekend. The enrolment in Scout Movement strengthens the personality of the students and helps them imbibe a sense of social responsibility. They become disciplined and courageous and are in the forefront during critical times.</p>

        <h1 style="f"> Educational tours</h1>

        <p id="p1">An educational tour is a welcome-break in the routine as it offers an opportunity for a rich experience. It facilitates learning while travelling. The school organizes different educational tours for students of classes VI-XII, to have the chance of experiencing the culture, connecting it with the people and place, on a much deeper level than they ever could do in the classroom. Students have the opportunity to move and interact with the society, which can broaden their perspective to a greater extent.They learn travel etiquettes and the tour that is organised for pleasure becomes a treasure. Such tours result in rejuvenation and help in appreciation of the rich cultural heritage. Students are independent and learn to adapt to the real life environments, away from their Home and Parents.All tour arrangements are made four months in advance. For class XII, the arrangements are made six months in advance. The tour dates are notified in the calendar. Those students, who are not willing to participate in the tour for whatever reason, should give a letter to that effect, 120 days in advance. For any withdrawal at a later date, a fixed fee will be collected from the parents along with the next term fee.</p>
